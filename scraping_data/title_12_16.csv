Mr. LODGE introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Whereas the first President of the United States was not inauffurated until the thirtieth day of April, in the year seventeen
hundred and eighty-nine; and
Whereas the day which was chosen by the Continental Congress
for the installation of the new Government then established
by the Constitution, the fourth day of March, does now cause
a public inconvenience in unduly curtailing and limiting the
second session of every Congress; and
Whereas it is fitting that the one hundredth anniversary of the
inauguration of George Washington as the first President of
the United States be commemorated by the inauguration of
his successor in eighteen hundred and eighty-nine upon the
same day, and that this should be the day hereafter for the
beginning of successive administrations of the Government:
Therefore,

Besolved by the Senate and House of Bepresentatives

of the United States of America in Congress assembled

3

(two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the fol-

4

lowing article be proposed to the legislatures of the several

6

7

AETIOLE

XVI.

8

The term of office of the President and of the Fiftieth

9

Congress shall continue until the last Tuesday of April in the

10

tors whose existing term would otherwise expire on the fourth

12

day of March in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-nine,

13

or thereafter, shall continue in office until noon of the last

14

Tuesday in April succeeding such expiration ; and the last

15

Tuesday in April, at noon, shall thereafter be substituted for

16

the fourth of March as the commencement and termination of

the official term of the President, Vice-President, Senators,
