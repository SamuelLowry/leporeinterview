Mr. HILL introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLU
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States
in relation to the election of United States Senators.
Whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for and
constitutes three co-ordinate departments of Government,
namely, ""the legislative,"" ""the executive,"" and ""the judicial,"" to which are confided all the powers granted by the
people and the States to the Federal Government; and
Whereas each of these departments has distinct functions, powers,
and duties clearly defined by the Constitution, and each is independent of either or both the others in the exercise of the
powers or the performance of the duties confided and enjoined
by the Constitution; and
Whereas the Constitution, by direct words, conferred on the President of the United States, the head of the executive department, the power of appointing and removing all subordinate
officials in the executive and judicial departments, with the
sole limitation that certain appointments should be ""by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate;"" and
Whereas the Presidents of the United States, since the establishment of the Constitution, have exercised this power of appoint •

merit and removal at will, save when the same has been restricted by proper and constitutional methods; and
Whereas the Senate of the United States, a subordinate branch of
the legislative department of the Government, possessing only
limited powers of legislation, and absolutely without power
under the Constitution, except in connection with the House
of Representatives, to do any act or thing but consider treaties
and nominations, is now attempting to interfere with the power
confided solely to the President of removing officials: Therefore,
1

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives

2

of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

3

[two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That section

4

three of the Constitution of the United States be amended so

5

as to read as follows:

6

""SEC.

3 The Senate of the United States shall be com-

7

posed of two Senators from each State, chosen every sixth

8

year by the people of the several States ; and the electors in

9

each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors

10

of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.""
