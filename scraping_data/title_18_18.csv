Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to abolish
the electoral college and to provide for the direct election of the President
and Vice President of the United States.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
JANUARY 11, 2021
Mr. COHEN (for himself, Ms. LOFGREN, Ms. ESHOO, Ms. SCHAKOWSKY, Ms.
BROWNLEY, Mr. DEFAZIO, Mr. ESPAILLAT, Mr. GARAMENDI, and Mr.

Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States to abolish the electoral college and to provide
for the direct election of the President and Vice President of the United States.

Whereas the Founders of the Nation established the electoral
college in an era of limited nationwide communication
and information sharing;
Whereas the electoral college is premised on an antiquated
theory that citizens will have a better chance of knowing
about electors from their home States than about Presidential candidates from out of State;
Whereas the development of mass media and the internet has
made information about Presidential candidates easily ac-

cessible to United States citizens across the country and
around the world;
Whereas citizens now have a far better chance of knowing
about out-of-State Presidential candidates than about
Presidential electors from their home State;
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘I am not an advocate for
frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and
institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of
the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more
enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the
change of circumstances, institutions must advance also
to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a
man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy
as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of
their barbarous ancestors.’’;
Whereas since the Nation’s founding, United States citizens
have amended the Constitution to expand the opportunity
for citizens to directly elect their elected leaders;
Whereas the 15th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to vote regardless of race;
Whereas the 19th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to vote regardless of gender;

Whereas the 26th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens 18 years of age and older to vote regardless of age;
Whereas the 17th Amendment establishes both a precedent
and a preference for the direct election of citizens’ elected
representatives; and
Whereas the electoral college has become an anachronism:
