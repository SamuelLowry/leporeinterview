H. RES. 32.

IN THE HOUSE 01 REPRESENTATIVES
JANUARY

5, 1886.

Read twice, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed.

Mr. MOCOMAS introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Whereas a legislative body sitting under a State constitution has
no right to sell, to give, or to bargain away forever the taxing
power of a State, or by contract to deprive the State forever
of the power of taxation, and thus destroy the Government
which it was appointed to serve ; and
Whereas in the principle of construction long approved by the
Supreme Court of the United States no hinderance can be
seen to rich corporations making contracts with legislatures
as they best may for perpetual exemption from all tne burdens of supporting the Government; and
Whereas the result of such a pri- ciple, under the growing tendency
to special and partial legislation, is to exempt the rich from
taxation and cast all the burden of the support of Government and the payment of its debts on those who are too poor
or too honest to purchase such immunity ; and
Whereas in many States of the Union favored corporations now
enjoy this immunity from taxation upon many millions of dollars' worth of property, rapidly multiplying in value, but perpetually free from taxes paid by the people : Therefore,

1

Besolved by the Senate and House of Representatives

2

of the United States of America in Congress assembled

3

[two-thirds of each House concurring therein). That the

4

following amendment to the Constitution of the United States

5

he, and hereby is, proposed; which, when ratified by the legis-

6

latures of three-fourths of the several States, shall he valid to

7

all intents and purposes as part of said Constitution: The first

8

clause of section ten, article one, shall be amended so as to

9

read as follows:

10

■ ""No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or con-

11

federation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money;

12

emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a

13

tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex

14

post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts;

15

or grant any title of nobility: Provided, however, That no

16

State shall be precluded by the grant of any charter or act of

17

incorporation from taxing the capital stock or property of

18

such corporation; nor shall any charter or act of incorporation

19

heretofore granted or that may hereafter be granted by any

20

State be construed to preclude the State from the power of

21

taxation ; but the States shall have and retain the full power

22

and right of taxation as if the prohibition to pass laws im-

23

pairing the obligation of contracts had never been incorporated

24

in this Constitution.""
