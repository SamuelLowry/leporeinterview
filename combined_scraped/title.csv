Mr. HILL introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLU
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States
in relation to the election of United States Senators.
Whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for and
constitutes three co-ordinate departments of Government,
namely, ""the legislative,"" ""the executive,"" and ""the judicial,"" to which are confided all the powers granted by the
people and the States to the Federal Government; and
Whereas each of these departments has distinct functions, powers,
and duties clearly defined by the Constitution, and each is independent of either or both the others in the exercise of the
powers or the performance of the duties confided and enjoined
by the Constitution; and
Whereas the Constitution, by direct words, conferred on the President of the United States, the head of the executive department, the power of appointing and removing all subordinate
officials in the executive and judicial departments, with the
sole limitation that certain appointments should be ""by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate;"" and
Whereas the Presidents of the United States, since the establishment of the Constitution, have exercised this power of appoint •

merit and removal at will, save when the same has been restricted by proper and constitutional methods; and
Whereas the Senate of the United States, a subordinate branch of
the legislative department of the Government, possessing only
limited powers of legislation, and absolutely without power
under the Constitution, except in connection with the House
of Representatives, to do any act or thing but consider treaties
and nominations, is now attempting to interfere with the power
confided solely to the President of removing officials: Therefore,
1

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives

2

of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

3

[two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That section

4

three of the Constitution of the United States be amended so

5

as to read as follows:

6

""SEC.

3 The Senate of the United States shall be com-

7

posed of two Senators from each State, chosen every sixth

8

year by the people of the several States ; and the electors in

9

each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors

10

of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.""

JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Whereas the first President of the United States was not inauffurated until the thirtieth day of April, in the year seventeen
hundred and eighty-nine; and
Whereas the day which was chosen by the Continental Congress
for the installation of the new Government then established
by the Constitution, the fourth day of March, does now cause
a public inconvenience in unduly curtailing and limiting the
second session of every Congress; and
Whereas it is fitting that the one hundredth anniversary of the
inauguration of George Washington as the first President of
the United States be commemorated by the inauguration of
his successor in eighteen hundred and eighty-nine upon the
same day, and that this should be the day hereafter for the
beginning of successive administrations of the Government:
Therefore,

Besolved by the Senate and House of Bepresentatives

of the United States of America in Congress assembled

3

(two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the fol-

4

tors whose existing term would otherwise expire on the fourth

12

day of March in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-nine,

13

or thereafter, shall continue in office until noon of the last

14

Tuesday in April succeeding such expiration ; and the last

15

Tuesday in April, at noon, shall thereafter be substituted for

16

the fourth of March as the commencement and termination of

Whereas the Founders of the Nation established the electoral
college in an era of limited nationwide communication
and information sharing;
Whereas the electoral college is premised on an antiquated
theory that citizens will have a better chance of knowing
about electors from their home States than about Presidential candidates from out of State;
Whereas the development of mass media and the internet has

cessible to United States citizens across the country and
around the world;
Whereas citizens now have a far better chance of knowing
about out-of-State Presidential candidates than about
Presidential electors from their home State;
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘I am not an advocate for
frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and
institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of
the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more
enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the
change of circumstances, institutions must advance also
to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a
man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy
as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of
their barbarous ancestors.’’;
Whereas since the Nation’s founding, United States citizens
have amended the Constitution to expand the opportunity
for citizens to directly elect their elected leaders;
Whereas the 15th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to vote regardless of race;
Whereas the 19th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to vote regardless of gender;

Whereas the 26th Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens 18 years of age and older to vote regardless of age;
Whereas the 17th Amendment establishes both a precedent
and a preference for the direct election of citizens’ elected
representatives; and
Whereas the electoral college has become an anachronism:

JANUARY

5, 1886.

Read twice, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed.

Mr. MOCOMAS introduced the following joint resolution:

JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Whereas a legislative body sitting under a State constitution has
no right to sell, to give, or to bargain away forever the taxing
power of a State, or by contract to deprive the State forever
of the power of taxation, and thus destroy the Government
which it was appointed to serve ; and
Whereas in the principle of construction long approved by the
Supreme Court of the United States no hinderance can be
seen to rich corporations making contracts with legislatures
as they best may for perpetual exemption from all tne burdens of supporting the Government; and
Whereas the result of such a pri- ciple, under the growing tendency
to special and partial legislation, is to exempt the rich from
taxation and cast all the burden of the support of Government and the payment of its debts on those who are too poor
or too honest to purchase such immunity ; and
Whereas in many States of the Union favored corporations now
enjoy this immunity from taxation upon many millions of dollars' worth of property, rapidly multiplying in value, but perpetually free from taxes paid by the people : Therefore,

1

Besolved by the Senate and House of Representatives

2

of the United States of America in Congress assembled

3

[two-thirds of each House concurring therein). That the

4

following amendment to the Constitution of the United States

5

he, and hereby is, proposed; which, when ratified by the legis-

6

latures of three-fourths of the several States, shall he valid to

7

all intents and purposes as part of said Constitution: The first

8

clause of section ten, article one, shall be amended so as to

9

read as follows:

10

■ ""No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or con-

11

federation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money;

12

emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a

13

tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex

14

post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts;

15

or grant any title of nobility: Provided, however, That no

16

State shall be precluded by the grant of any charter or act of

17

incorporation from taxing the capital stock or property of

18

such corporation; nor shall any charter or act of incorporation

19

heretofore granted or that may hereafter be granted by any

20

State be construed to preclude the State from the power of

21

taxation ; but the States shall have and retain the full power

22

and right of taxation as if the prohibition to pass laws im-

23

pairing the obligation of contracts had never been incorporated

24

in this Constitution.""
