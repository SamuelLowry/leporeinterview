The liberty of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children is a fundamental right (ACFC endorses adding ‘regardless of marital status’ to the end of this section, thereby extending the amendment’s protection to all parents.)
SECTION 2
Neither the United States nor any state shall infringe upon this right without demonstrating that its governmental interest as applied to the person is of the highest order and not otherwise served.
SECTION 3
Neither treaty nor any source of international law may be employed to supersede, modify, interpret, or apply to the rights guaranteed by this article.
An amendment to the United States Constitution would secure the ultimate liberty that the founders envisioned when our constitution was written. The liberty interest parents have in their offspring must be formally protected. The Supreme Court has ruled that the fundamental right of the parent-child relationship is a right far more precious than property rights.
Let’s do as the Irish have done. Let us state our intention to protect our children and future generations from the misery that unjustified State intervention into familial affairs represents. Our Supreme Court has spoken, yet its opinions are ignored.
